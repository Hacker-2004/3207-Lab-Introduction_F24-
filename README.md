# 3207-Lab-Introduction_F24
In this lab, you will be learning about Git and some of the features of Git and GitHub. A part of the lab will be to clone this repository and then make changes to the repository.

There are 4 files in total.

The random.h has the function randchar() as head so that I can make changes to the function in
random.c and can call it in print_random.c

The random.c is the place where I make the function where I random character gets generated.

The print_random.c is where there are 2 functions and one main to run the program. One of the
functions randstring makes a 7-char word using the randchar(). the allocation function calls to 
allocate memory and use it for the randstring function. In the main, I print the word.

the print_random is the program. to run it use ./print_random to get the 7-word string
